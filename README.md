# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
Project background and context
SpaceX is a company that specializes in affordable rocket launches. This is made possible by the reuse of the first stage of Falcon 9 rockets. By determining whether the first stage will land, we can determine the price of the launch. With the use of data and analytics we can predict whether Space 
By determining if the first stage will land, we can determine the price of the launch. To do this, we can use public data and machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
